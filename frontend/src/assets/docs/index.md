# BSci KMS Guide

Here you'll find a *friendly* introduction & guide to the KMS — a lightweight but powerful tool to find and organise knowledge artifacts. It only takes a minute to get started. You'll also find feature details and ongoing research.

## Design

The KMS indexes BSci artifacts from a variety of platforms and sources, this ingress process is designed to be robust and tolerant of interruptions. These artifacts can be found through simple text-based searches — this is the easiest and simplest way to interact with KMS. Text search is tolerant of misspellings, supports many common search features, and can include multiple statements forming complex queries that filter and sort results. KMS uses well-established cloud infrastructure and lightweight frameworks, allowing the system to be low-maintenance and a good testbed for research. Perhaps most importantly, KMS serves a pragmatic role in the BSci organisation to find, discover, and organise research artifacts.
