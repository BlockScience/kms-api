# Shortcuts

There are a few keyboard shortcuts to make life easier and to help avoid using the mouse for basic navigation and common actions.

- `/` selects the search bar and its content
- `Alt` shows contextual information about search results and tags
- `Tab` navigates to the next tag input
- `Shift + Tab` navigates to the previous tag input
- `Shift + Enter` saves any curation changes on the page

## Slash Commands

Starting a search with a "/" character will be interpreted as a command instead of a query.

- `/add <url>` will attempt to ingress the given url.
- `/unlist <url>` removes the specified artifact and blocks it from being ingressed
- `/relist <url>` allows a artifact to be ingressed again
- `/schema [tag]` takes you to the schema page
- `/console` will take you to the console page
