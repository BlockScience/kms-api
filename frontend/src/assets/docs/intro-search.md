# Search

Searching can be as simple as typing some text and hitting `Enter`. This will search fields like text, title, tags, etc. and return results based on the closeness of the match and the artifact ranking â€“ ranking is determined by the ingress pipeline, so for example, a google doc is ranked higher than a slack message. All else being equal, higher ranked artifacts will appear first.
