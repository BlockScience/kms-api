# Customisation & Feedback

You can tweak your own search results and give feedback on the search results page. The box before the first search hit, which shows how many results your search got, can be clicked to reveal a few tweaks such as results per page and a handy feedback box.

If you encounter a bug, have an issue with a search result, or have a thought on how the KMS can be improved, please submit it while it's on your mind!
