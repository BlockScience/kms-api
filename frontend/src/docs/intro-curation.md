# Curation

Curation is done through the tagging interaction widget which is positioned at the bottom of every artifact and is shown as three dots ("...") if no tags are present. To add or edit tags, simply select the widget and start typing. Existing and suggested tags will be shown while you type and can be selected with a click or by pressing the `Right Arrow` button. To remove a tag, either click on the "X" or hit `Backspace`. To save changes, hit the save changes button which appears at the top of the screen, or press `Shift + Enter`.
